# ezpylogger
Highly customizable and yet very simple key logger written in python.

Can log key presses, log mouse clicks and take screenshots.

## Installation
You can download the script as an executable file, compiled with pyinstaller, so that it can also be executed on machines that don't have python installed.

If you want to compile it yourself, you can just install the dependencies with pip and then compile it using pyinstaller.

```bash
pyinstaller -F ezpylogger.py
```

## Usage
Remember that the script includes really good customization options in the code, you might wanna check them out depending on your use case.

In general, after being executed, this script will seamlessy log user actions and store them either in a folder or next to the script (see: default options)

You can stop the script by pressing the "F12" key by default, or by killing its process (duh).
